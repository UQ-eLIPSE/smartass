%%BEGIN QUESTION

Peter needs to pay a bill of \$#<v1.I#>  in #<v1.t#> years' time. His bank account
earns #<v1.rpercent#> percent interest each year, compounding continuously. How much money does he need
to invest now in order to exactly cover his bill in #<v1.t#> years? Ignore fees and taxes,
and round your answer to cents.

%%END QUESTION

%%BEGIN SOLUTION

Let $B$ be the amount of the bill, $I$ be the amount he needs to invest, $r$ be the
interest rate and $t$ be the number of years.  Then
$B=Ie^{rt}$ so $I=\displaystyle\frac{B}{e^{rt}}$, so $I=Be^{-rt}$. Then
\begin{eqnarray*}
I&=&#<v1.I#>e^{-#<v1.r#>\times #<v1.t#>}\\
&=&#<v1.I#>e^{-#<v1.rt#>}\\
&\approx&#<v1.decaysol#>
\end{eqnarray*}
Hence he needs to invest approximately \$#<v1.decaysol#> .

%%END SOLUTION

%%BEGIN SHORTANSWER

\$#<v1.decaysol#>
