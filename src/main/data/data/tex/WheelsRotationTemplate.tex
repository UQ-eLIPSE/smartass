%%BEGIN QUESTION
A machine has #<v1.number#> wheels, making #<v1.question#> revolutions (respectively)
per minute. At time 0, each of the wheels starts with a certain marked point on
its circumference pointing directly downwards. At what time will all of the wheels first 
come back together in the same starting position?
%%END QUESTION

%%BEGIN SOLUTION
The highest common factor of #<v1.question#> is #<v1.hcf#>. 
This means that in #<v1.oneoverhcf#> 
(that is, in #<v1.seconds#> seconds) the wheels will all come back together
to their starting positions. 
%%END SOLUTION


%%BEGIN SHORTANSWER
#<v1.seconds#> seconds
%%END SHORTANSWER
