%%BEGIN QUESTION
Find the equation of the straight line with gradient $m=#<v1.m#>$ 
passing through the point $(#<v1.x1#>,#<v1.y1#>)$.
%%END QUESTION

%%BEGIN SOLUTION
Thus the equation of the line is $y=#<v1.m#>x+c$ and we can substitute the coordinates of the point
$(x_{1}, y_{1})=(#<v1.x1#>,#<v1.y1#>)$ into this equation to get the value for $c$.
Hence $#<v1.substituted#>$ , so $#<v1.c#>=c$.

Hence the equation of the line is   $#<v1.equation#>$.
%%END SOLUTION

%%BEGIN SHORTANSWER
$#<v1.equation#>$
%%END SHORTANSWER
