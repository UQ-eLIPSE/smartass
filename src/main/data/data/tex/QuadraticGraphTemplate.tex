%%BEGIN QUESTION
Given the quadratic equation $y = #<v1.quadratic#>$:

(a) Find the roots of $y$.

(b) Find the $y$-intercept of the quadratic.

(c) Sketch the graph of the quadratic.
%%END QUESTION

%%BEGIN SOLUTION
(a) The roots of $y = #<v1.quadratic#>$ are the $x$ values that satisfy 
$#<v1.quadratic#> = 0$. You can solve this equation either by using the quadratic formula or by factoring. 
Here we will use factoring. \\

\ifnum #<v1.coeff2#> = -1
First multiply through by $-1$ to get $#<v1.normQuadratic#> = 0$.
\else
	\ifnum #<v1.coeff2#> = 1
	\else
	First divide through by $#<v1.coeff2#>$ to get $#<v1.normQuadratic#> = 0$.
	\fi
\fi
Now because $#<v1.normQuadratic#> = #<v1.factQuadratic#>$,
\ifnum #<v1.root1#> = #<v1.root2#>
	the root of the quadratic equation is $x = #<v1.root1#>$.
\else
	the two roots of the quadratic equation are $x = #<v1.root1#>$, $#<v1.root2#>$.
\fi
\\

(b) The $y$-intercept occurs when $x = 0$, so substituting this into $y = #<v1.quadratic#>$ gives
$y = #<v1.yIntercept#>$. \\

(c) #<v1.graph#>
%%END SOLUTION

%%BEGIN SHORTANSWER
(a) 
\ifnum #<v1.root1#> = #<v1.root2#>
	The root of the quadratic equation is $x = #<v1.root1#>$.
\else
	The two roots of the quadratic equation are $x = #<v1.root1#>$, $#<v1.root2#>$.
\fi

(b) The $y$-intercept is at $y = #<v1.yIntercept#>$.

(c) #<v1.graph#>
