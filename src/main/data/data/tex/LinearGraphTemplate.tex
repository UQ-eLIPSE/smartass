%%BEGIN QUESTION
Given the linear equation $#<v1.linear#> = 0$:

(a) Find the $y$-intercept of the line.

(b) Find the $x$-intercept of the line.

(c) Sketch the graph of the line.
%%END QUESTION

%%BEGIN SOLUTION
(a) First we rearrange the equation to get $#<v1.rearranged#>$.
\ifnum #<v1.coeff0#> = 0
	\ifnum #<v1.coeff2#> = 0
		Therefore, $x = 0$ regardless of the value of $y$. The
		line doesn't intercept the $y$-axis in a single point, but does
		so in every point.
	\else
		Therefore, $#<v1.rearranged#>$ regardless of the value
		of $y$. Hence, the line does not intercept the $y$-axis at all and there
		is no $y$-intercept.
	\fi	
\else
	\ifnum #<v1.coeff1#> = 0
		The line $#<v1.rearranged#>$ has constant $y$-value. Hence,
		the $y$-intercept is $y = #<v1.yIntercept#>$.
	\else
		The $y$-intercept of $#<v1.rearranged#>$ may be found by substituting $x = 0$ into
		the equation giving $y = #<v1.yIntercept#>$ as the $y$-intercept.
	\fi
\fi
\\


(b) 
\ifnum #<v1.coeff1#> = 0
	\ifnum #<v1.coeff2#> = 0
		For the line $#<v1.rearranged#>$, regardless of the value of $x$, $y$ is zero. The
		line does not intercept the $x$-axis in a single point, but does
		so in every point.
	\else
		For the line $#<v1.rearranged#>$, regardless of the value of $x$, $y$ is $#<v1.yIntercept#>$. 
		Hence, the line does not intercept the $x$-axis at all and there is no $x$-intercept.
	\fi	
\else
	\ifnum #<v1.coeff0#> = 0
		The line $#<v1.rearranged#>$ has constant $x$-value. Hence,
		the $x$-intercept is $x = #<v1.xIntercept#>$.
	\else
		The $x$-intercept of $#<v1.rearranged#>$ may be found by substituting $y = 0$ into
		the equation giving $x = #<v1.xIntercept#>$ as the $x$-intercept.
	\fi
\fi

\ifnum #<v1.equalScale#> = 1
	(c) #<v1.graph#>
\else
	(c) (Note that the scaling of the axes on the graph below are not equal.)

	#<v1.graph#>
\fi
