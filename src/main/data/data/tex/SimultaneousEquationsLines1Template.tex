%%BEGIN QUESTION
Do the lines $#<v1.equation1#>$ and $#<v1.equation2#>$ intersect? 
If so, find the point of intersection.
%%END QUESTION

%%BEGIN SOLUTION
We need to find a solution for two simultaneous linear equations.\\ 
#<v1.solution#>
\if o#<v1.numberofsolutions#>
Hence the simultaneous solution to equations (1) and (2) is \hspace{1.5mm}$(#<v1.x#>,#<v1.y#>)$.\\
\\
(As good boys and girls always do, check your answers by substituting into equations (1) and (2): 
#<v1.check#>
Both equations turned into true statements, as required. Hence the answer is correct.) \\

\fi 
\if n#<v1.numberofsolutions#>

\fi
\if i#<v1.numberofsolutions#>
The lines are superimposed.
\fi
%%END SOLUTION

%%BEGIN SHORTANSWER
\if o#<v1.numberofsolutions#>
The lines intersect at the point $(#<v1.x#>,#<v1.y#>)$
\fi
\if i#<v1.numberofsolutions#>
The lines are superimposed.
\fi
\if n#<v1.numberofsolutions#>
The lines do not interset; they  are parallel.
\fi
