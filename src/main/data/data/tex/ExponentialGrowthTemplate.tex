%%BEGIN QUESTION
POD has a sample of a species of bacteria, the population of which
increases by a factor of #<v1.scale#> in each generation.  If POD
originally started with #<v1.start#> bacteria, write a Python program
using Euler's method to approximate how many bacteria are present
after #<v1.numGens#> generations.

Hint: the derivative that you are solving is #<v1.func#>.

%%END SOLUTION

%%BEGIN SHORTANSWER
#<v1.resultwarning#>

The approximate number of bacteria present after #<v1.numGens#>
generations is: #<v1.answer#>.
