              <h2>What is Smart Assignments?</h2>
              <p>
                <em>SmartAss</em>, short for SmartAssignments, is a FREE online 
                question and solution generator designed to improve students’ 
                mathematical skills and intuition. This open-access system allows 
                teaching staff and students to create an unlimited number of 
                questions covering over 100 topics, ranging from order of 
                operations through to calculus and linear algebra. 
              </p>
              <p>The main features of the software include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  automatically generating a suite of random questions and 
                  corresponding <strong>fully worked, formatted solutions</strong> 
                  to every question, clearly and unambiguously reproducing the 
                  steps that students would typically take when correctly 
                  solving the problem;
                </li>
                <li>
                  providing students with a mechanism for concentrating on those 
                  concepts which cause them difficulties, enabling inquiry-based 
                  learning and improving their technical and creative abilities;
                  </li>
                <li>
                  implementing a powerful learning aid that gives support for both 
                  introductory and advanced mathematical concepts and processes;
                  </li>
                <li>
                  allowing instructors to efficiently and easily create resources 
                  for illustrative examples, practice materials and individualised 
                  assessment;
                  </li>
                <li>
                  being directly usable in all discipline areas that require 
                  quantitative skills;
                  </li>
                <li>
                  free availability to the education community as open-source 
                  software, with a modular design allowing components to be 
                  easily redesigned and extended.
                  </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <em>SmartAss</em> was developed as part of a 2006 Office for 
                Learning and Teaching (OLT) grant (Project Reference CG6-24).
