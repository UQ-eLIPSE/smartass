%%BEGIN QUESTION

Populations of bacteria (and indeed many other organisms) exhibit population
growth that can be modelled using continuous compounding. The rate of population
growth depends on such factors as fertility, temperature, level of interactions and so on. 

A certain type of bacterium has a population growth rate of #<v1.r#> per hour. If there are 
#<v1.I#> million bacteria in a petri dish at time 0, how many will there be after
#<v1.t#> hours? (Give your answer in millions, rounded to two decimal places.)

%%END QUESTION

%%BEGIN SOLUTION

Let $P$ be the final population in millions. Then
\begin{eqnarray*}
P&=&#<v1.I#>e^{#<v1.r#>\times #<v1.t#>}\\
&=&#<v1.I#>e^{#<v1.rt#>}\\
&\approx&#<v1.growthsol#>
\end{eqnarray*}
Hence the final population is approximately #<v1.growthsol#> million bacteria.

%%END SOLUTION

%%BEGIN SHORTANSWER

#<v1.growthsol#>
