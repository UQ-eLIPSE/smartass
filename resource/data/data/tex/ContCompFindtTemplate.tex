%%BEGIN QUESTION

Before Damien can marry Celeste, he must prove to her father that he can save the deposit for
a house. He has \$#<v1.I#> to invest, his account pays #<v1.rpercent#> percent interest per annum, compounding
continuously, and he needs to have a total of \$#<v1.Fwant#> before he can get married. 
He is currently #<v1.now#> years old. At what age can he get married?

%%END QUESTION

%%BEGIN SOLUTION

Let $F$ be the final amount he needs, $I$ be the amount he has to invest, $r$ be the
interest rate and $t$ be the number of years.  Then
$F=Ie^{rt}$ so $e^{rt}=\frac{F}{I}$, so $rt=\ln{\frac{F}{I}}$, 
and $t=\left(\ln{\frac{F}{I}}\right)\div r$ . Then
\begin{eqnarray*}
t&=&\left(\ln{\frac{#<v1.Fwant#>}{#<v1.I#>}}\right)\div#<v1.r#>\\
&=&\left(\ln{#<v1.foni#>}\right)\div#<v1.r#>\\
&\approx&#<v1.logfoni#>\div#<v1.r#>\\
&\approx&#<v1.tsol#>
\end{eqnarray*}
Hence he needs to invest \$#<v1.I#> for approximately #<v1.tsol#> years. Therefore Damien can marry 
Celeste when he is about #<v1.tage#> years old.

%%END SOLUTION

%%BEGIN SHORTANSWER

#<v1.tage#>
