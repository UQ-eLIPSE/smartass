%Assign any required modules here.
%It is possible to register which 'modules' a particular template uses in the database,
%but I'm not sure what (or if) the table is used. All modules require a default constuctor
%which will generally create random values in required ranges for any parameters. It is 
%also (teorectically) possible to supply initialization parameters by overriding the 
%`initialise` method of `QuestionModule` in your modules.
