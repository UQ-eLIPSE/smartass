%%BEGIN QUESTION
What two consecutive integers add together to give #<v1.solution#>?
%%END QUESTION

%%BEGIN SOLUTION
Since the two integers are consecutive, we know that there is a
difference of one between them.  Let the smaller integer be
represented by #<v1.var1#>, so the larger integer will then be
#<v1.var2#>.  We then have:

#<v1.working#>

Note that this gives us the value of the \emph{lower} integer only!
We need \emph{both} integers!

So if the smaller number is #<v1.num1#>, then the larger number must
be #<v1.num2#>.
%%END SOLUTION

%%BEGIN SHORTANSWER
#<v1.num1#> and #<v1.num2#>
%%END SHORTANSWER
