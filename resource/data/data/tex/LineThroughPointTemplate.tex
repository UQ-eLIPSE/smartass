%%BEGIN QUESTION
Does the line \hspace{2mm} #<v1.equation#> \hspace{2mm} 
pass through the point $(#<v1.x1#>,#<v1.y1#>)$ ?
%%END QUESTION

%%BEGIN SOLUTION
To determine whether the given line passes through the point $(x_{1}, y_{1})=(#<v1.x1#>,#<v1.y1#>)$, 
 we need to substitute the coordinates of the point into the equation of the line. Now, 
#<v1.solution#>
\if y#<v1.yorn#>
The last statement is {\bf true}, so our line {\bf does} pass through the point $(#<v1.x1#>,#<v1.y1#>)$.  
\else
The last statement is {\bf not true}, so our line {\bf does not} pass through the point $(#<v1.x1#>,#<v1.y1#>)$.  
\fi
%%END SOLUTION

%%BEGIN SHORTANSWER
\if y#<v1.yorn#>
Yes  
\else
No  
\fi
%%END SHORTANSWER
