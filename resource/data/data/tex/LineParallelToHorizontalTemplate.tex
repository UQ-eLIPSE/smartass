%%BEGIN QUESTION
Find the equation of the line parallel to \hspace{2mm} #<v1.originalequation#> \hspace{2mm} and 
passing through the point $(#<v1.x1#>,#<v1.y1#>)$.
%%END QUESTION

%%BEGIN SOLUTION
To find the equation of the new line, we first need the gradient of the original line. Now, 
#<v1.rewriteoriginalequation#>
Hence, the gradient of the original line is  $m=#<v1.m#>$. \\
The new line is parallel to the original line, so it has the same gradient as the original line. Thus the equation
of the line is \hspace{2mm} #<v1.newequation#> \hspace{2mm} and we can substitute the coordinates of the point
 $(x_{1}, y_{1})=(#<v1.x1#>,#<v1.y1#>)$ into this equation to get the value for $c$.\\
#<v1.findc#>\\
Hence the equation of the line is  \hspace{2mm} $#<v1.equation#>$.
%%END SOLUTION

%%BEGIN SHORTANSWER
$#<v1.equation#>$
