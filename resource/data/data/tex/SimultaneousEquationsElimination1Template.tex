%%BEGIN QUESTION
Solve \begin{align*}
#<v1.equation1#>\\
#<v1.equation2#>
\end{align*}
%%END QUESTION

%%BEGIN SOLUTION
#<v1.solution#>
\if o#<v1.numberofsolutions#>
Hence the simultaneous solution to equations (1) and (2) is \hspace{1.5mm}$(#<v1.x#>,#<v1.y#>)$.\\
\\
(As good boys and girls always do, check your answers by substituting into equations (1) and (2): 
#<v1.check#>
Both equations turned into true statements, as required. Hence the answer is correct.)

%%END SOLUTION

%%BEGIN SHORTANSWER
\if o#<v1.numberofsolutions#>
$(#<v1.x#>,#<v1.y#>)$
\fi
\if i#<v1.numberofsolutions#>
There is an infinite number of solutions.
\fi
\if n#<v1.numberofsolutions#>
There is no solution; the lines are parallel.
